                OVERPEPE is tired of watching everyone play hot potato with the
                endless derivative ShibaCumGMElonKishuTurboAssFlokiMoon Inu
                coins. The PEPE have had their day. Itâ€™s time for the most
                recognizable meme in the world to take his reign as king of the
                memes.

                OVERPEPE is here to make memecoin great again. $OVERPEPE will
                adopt the latest presale mechanism, a 1% tax, and renounced
                contract, making it truly the people's coin. Driven by the pure
                power of memes, let $OVERPEPE show you the way.
